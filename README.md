# Project-FishingApp
The application that I will be creating is a fishing app.




 # Overview
 My app will consist of the best kinds of fish to go out and catch in the one and only Tampa-Bay, FLorida. It will also give the user the capability to check the weather the day of which they want to go out and cast!

 As the creator, I will build a platform that makes it very easy and simple for anyone to not just browse through the app but get wonderful information about the fish itself.
